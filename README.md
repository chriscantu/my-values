Simple list of the values I try to live by

* **Family First** - Despite my commitment to my work and what it means to me, I will always place the needs of my family first
* **Mission:**
	* To serve something bigger than myself
	* To balance all of my decisions, recommendations and actions on what best supports our mission
* **Serve Racker and Customers....in that order**
	* To treat all by the 'Platinum Rule' - *Treat others like they want to be treated*
* **Have fun in all my work**
